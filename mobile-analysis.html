            <h1>Mobile Browsing - Analysis </h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <!-- ***********************************************
Outline what you were asked to do and how well you completed the assignment.
You may want to review the questions you were asked to consider.  If you need more than one paragraph just add another by adding the opening and closing paragraph tags...like this: <p>new paragraph text here</p>
************************************************* -->
            <p>In this assignment I was asked to only browse the web on a mobile device for 24 hours. I completed the assignment, and found that I could still see what I wanted to see and find what I was looking for, but there were some occasional frustrations. </p>
            
            <h2>Questions to consider:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
                <li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
                <li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
                <li>Any frustrations?</li>
                <li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <!-- for each question give your general experience, and then give a specific example of a site that you though did a good or bad job with this.  Do not use the same site for all examples! -->
            <h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
            <p>Yes, every site I went to allowed me to see what I wanted to see.</p>
            <h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Some sites may have been a little more difficult to find what I was looking for than others, but I could always find it.</p>
            <h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
            <p>Yes, I was able to do what I wanted to do.</p>
            <h3>Any frustrations?</h3>
            <p>Some sites were running slow, and some of them were hard to navigate on the smaller screen.</p>
            <h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>
            <p>Using some news sites worked better on the small screen because it allowed me to quickly view what was happening one at a time, then move to the next item.</p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>After doing this activity I learned that mobile browsing has to be designed differently from desktop browsing, because certain things like the size of the page or various layout choices can be detrimental to a positive browsing experience on a smaller screen.</p>
            
            <h2>List of sites</h2>
            <!-- list out the sites you used as examples above.  The href="" portion is where you will put the URL to the site.  In between the <a></a> is where you will put the clickable text the use will see.  The first link to Google is given as an example...you should change it to one of your links. -->
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">New York Times</a></li>
