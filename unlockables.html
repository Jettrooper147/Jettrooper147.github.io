            <p>In Overwatch, there are many different cosmetic items that can be unlocked. There are two ways to get these items: either through opening loot boxes or by purchasing items with credits. These cosmetic items come in various types such as skins, emotes, profile icons, sprays, voice lines, etc.</p>

            <h2>Loot Boxes</h2>
            <p>Loot boxes can be obtained through a few means. You earn one each time you level up, you can earn a few each week for wins in the arcade, or they can be purchased with real money. Each loot box will give you 4 random items, of which could be cosmetic items, duplicate items that you will recieve credits for instead, or you could recieve a pile of credits as well.</p>

            <h2>Credits</h2>
            <p>The other option to obtain items is by purchasing the item with credits. This option is good for when you want a specific item but haven't recieved it in a loot box. The price of items is determined by it's rariry, which is as follows:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Common/White: </b>25 Credits</li>
                <li><b>Uncommon/Blue: </b>75 Credits</li>
                <li><b>Epic/Purple: </b>250 Credits</li>
                <li><b>Legendary/Orange: </b>1000 Credits</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Events</h2>
            <p>There are also time-limited events in Overwatch, where some special loot boxes are given out instead of normal ones. During this time, these special loot boxes can contain limited time, special cosmetic items limited to that event. These items can be purchased with credits as well, but only while that event is going on, and for triple the normal cost of the item determined by it's rarity.</p>
